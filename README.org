* About
  Colors provides color manipulation routines to
  Clojure. Currently,this is mostly a port of the color.rb module in
  the ruby SASS project to Clojure:
 
  [[http://github.com/nex3/haml/blob/master/lib/sass/script/color.rb]]

  In the future it would be great to have some sort of color theme
  abilities found in R's ColorBrewer package.
